# BattleBots

Battle Bots is a multiplayer PvP prototype, where players brawl across a variety of maps in a 3D Smash Bro's style of gameplay. Dynamic map elements and a multitude of explosive projectiles add a high degree of chaos to each match.

Areas of focus for this project:
- Peer to Peer networking using Mirror. One player can host a match where opponents can drop in and out.
- Lag Compensated projectiles, so clients can all see the same positions and speeds of gunfire.
- Synchronzied dynamic map elements. Rotating and moving map hazards that can hit the players are kept in sync across clients.
- Object pooling for projectiles and effects, to increase performance when matches get chaotic.
